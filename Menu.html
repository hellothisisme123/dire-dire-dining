                    <p>Complete with a dipping sauce of your choice we serve our chicken in sizes, 5-8-14. We developed our recipe from the original chicken man back in 2800 B.C. The chicken man was known as a king and ruled over his chicken people with an iron fist. He would feed them well and defended his city in Italy. Unfortunately all the original texts were lost when Rome was founded and their kings burned the chicken relics. Luckily we sent investigators into the city undercover and found fragments of the original chicken man's recipes.</p>

                    <h1 class="dollarcost">$6.99</h1>
                    <p>This burger is meant to be kept simple. The name explains everything you need to know. It's the same Dire Dire Burg, but it's vegan. We have tried our absolute hardest to keep the taste and texture nearly identical to the original. We've been told many times again that it tastes exactly the same but with a slightly sweet aftertaste. We haven't decided to change this though because our customers who would eat this over and over again tend to prefer the sweet aftertaste. In the future if enough customers want it we may dedicate our resources into changing he burger, or add a new burger altogether like we've done in the past.</p>

                    <p>Our Infamous Chicken burger is known for its misleadingly high spice. Please be warned that despite the bland look it boasts a scoville unit value into 6 digits.

We add the seasoning right before serving to keep the meat fresh and to keep serving without seasoning fast.
